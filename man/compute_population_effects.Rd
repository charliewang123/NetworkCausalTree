\arguments{
\item{N}{Sample size}

\item{W}{N x 1 vector, Individual Treatment}

\item{G}{N x 1 vector, Neighborhood Treatment}

\item{Y}{N x 1 vector, Observed Outcome}

\value{
A numeric vector made up by four elements, representing the
estimated effects in the whole population: the first element is the effect 1000,
the second one refers to the effect 1101, the third one refers to 1110 and the
fourth refers to 0100
