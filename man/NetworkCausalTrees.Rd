\value{
A data.frame describing the obtained Network Causal Trees.
Each row represents a partition (of a specific tree) with 10/14 entries.
Columns summary:
\itemize{
\item \code{OF}: value of the OF in the corresponding partition,
\item \code{NOBS_TR}: number of training observations in the partition,
\item \code{FILTER}: values of the covariates \code{X} that identify the partition,
\item \code{IDTREE}: tree ID,
\item \code{NUMTREE}: number of trees identifying the partition,
\item \code{NOBS_EST}: number of estimation observations in the partition,
\item \code{EFF1000_EST}: estimated 1000 effects in the partitions,
\item \code{EFF1101_EST}: estimated 1101 effects in the partitions,
\item \code{EFF1110_EST}: estimated 1110 effects in the partitions,
\item \code{EFF0100_EST}: estimated 0100 effects in the partitions.
Additional columns summary (only if output = "Estimation"):
\item \code{SETAU1000_EST}: estimated std. error of the 1000 effect in the partition,
\item \code{SETAU1101_EST}: estimated std. error of the 1101 effect in the partition,
\item \code{SETAU1110_EST}: estimated std. error of the 1110 effect in the partition,
\item \code{SETAU0100_EST}: estimated std. error of the 0100 effect in the partition.
