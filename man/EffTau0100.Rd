\usage{
EffTau0100(N, W, G, Y, p, Ne)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Sample size}

\item{W}{N x 1 vector, Individual Treatment}

\item{G}{N x 1 vector, Neighborhood Treatment}

\item{Y}{N x 1 vector, Observed Outcome}

\item{p}{N x 1 vector, Probability to be assigned to the active individual intervention}

\item{Ne}{N x 1 vector, Degree}
}
\value{
A numeric value corresponding to the estimate of the effect
of interest.
}
\description{
Computes the estimate of the spillover effect in the absence of an individual
exposure to the intervention.
This effect compares individuals with the joint treatment exposure (w = 0, g = 1)
with those with (w = 0, g = 0)
