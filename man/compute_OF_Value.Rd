"composite" for NCT targeted to multiple effects; "penalized" for a OF computed while
considering a single effect only and including a penalization term related to the variance}

\item{gamma}{weight associated to the effect 1110}

\item{delta}{weight associated to the effect 0100}

\item{N}{Sample size}

\item{W}{N x 1 vector, Individual Treatment}

\item{G}{N x 1 vector, Neighborhood Treatment}

\item{Y}{N x 1 vector, Observed Outcome}

\item{p}{N x 1 vector,Probability to be assigned to the active individual intervention}

\item{Ne}{N x 1 vector, Degree}

\item{Ne_list}{List of N elements - where N is the sample size -
where each element i contains the IDs of the direct neighbors of unit i}

\item{population_effects}{4 dimensional vector containing the estimated effects in the
whole population}

\item to be included if method = "penalized" - whole variance
}}
