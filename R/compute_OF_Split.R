#' Split Objective Function
#'
#' @description
#' Splits the sample where the  Objective Function is maximized
#'
#' @param method method to compute the Objective function: "singular" for NCT targeted to one single effect;
#' "composite" for NCT targeted to multiple effects; "penalized" for a OF computed while
#' considering a single effect only and including a penalization term related to the variance
#' @param alpha weight associated to the effect 1000
#' @param beta weight associated to the effect 1101
#' @param gamma weight associated to the effect 1110
#' @param delta weight associated to the effect 0100
#' @param W N x 1 vector, Individual Treatment
#' @param G N x 1 vector, Neighborhood Treatment
#' @param Y N x 1 vector, Observed Outcome
#' @param X N x M matrix, Observed Covariate Matrix
#' @param p  N x 1 vector, Probability to be assigned to the active individual intervention
#' @param Ne N x 1 vector, Degree
#' @param Ne_list List of N elements - where N is the sample size -
#' where each element i contains the IDs of the direct neighbors of unit i
#' @param population_effects 4 dimensional vector containing the estimated effects in the
#' whole population
#' @param total_variance - to be included if method = "penalized" - whole variance
#' @param nleafs - to be included if method = "penalized" - number of leafs
#'
#' @return A numeric vector made up by three elements: the first one identifies the
#' value of the  Objective Function is max , the second one reports the value of the variable that maximizes the  Objective Function,
#' the third one reports the corresponding variable
