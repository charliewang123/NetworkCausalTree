## Getting Started

NetworkCausalTree is implemented in R and follows standard R development

    Conduct](https://github.com/charliewang123/NetworkCausalTree/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
2.  Check the [GitHub
    Issues](https://github.com/charliewang123/NetworkCausalTree/issues)
    page for existing issues or feature requests
3.  Review the package documentation and vignettes to understand the
    current functionality

## Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

### Bug Reports

If you find a bug, please report it by: 1. Opening a new issue on our
[GitHub
Issues](https://github.com/charliewang123/NetworkCausalTree/issues) page
2. Including a clear title and description 3. Providing a minimal
reproducible example 4. Specifying your R version, operating system, and
package version 5. Describing the expected vs. actual behavior

### Feature Requests

Have an idea for a new feature? We'd love to hear it! Please: 1. Check
if a similar request already exists in the Issues 2. Open a new issue
with the "enhancement" label 3. Clearly describe the feature and its
potential use cases 4. Explain how it would benefit users of the package

### Code Contributions

#### Setting Up Your Development Environment

``` r
# Install development dependencies
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat", "knitr"))

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/charliewang123/NetworkCausalTree.git
cd NetworkCausalTree

# Load the package for development
devtools::load_all()

# Run tests
devtools::test()

# Check package
devtools::check()
```

#### Contribution Workflow

1.  **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2.  **Clone your fork** locally:

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/NetworkCausalTree.git
    ```

3.  **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix:

    ``` bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

4.  **Make your changes** following our coding standards (see below)

5.  **Write or update tests** to cover your changes

6.  **Update documentation** as needed (including roxygen2 comments)

7.  **Run checks** to ensure everything passes:

    ``` r
    devtools::check()
    devtools::test()
    ```

8.  **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive commit messages:

    ``` bash
    git commit -m "Add feature: brief description of what you did"
    ```

9.  **Push to your fork**:

    ``` bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```

10. **Submit a Pull Request** on GitHub with a clear description of your
    changes

### Documentation Improvements

Documentation improvements are always welcome! This includes:\
- Fixing typos or clarifying existing documentation\
- Adding examples to function documentation\
- Improving or creating vignettes\
- Updating the README

To update function documentation:\
1. Edit the roxygen2 comments in the R source files\
2. Run `devtools::document()` to regenerate the documentation\
3. Preview changes with `?function_name`

### Vignettes and Examples

We encourage contributions that improve reproducibility: - Add example
scripts demonstrating specific use cases\
- Create or improve vignettes showing real-world applications\
- Provide datasets that illustrate network causal inference scenarios

## Coding Standards

To maintain consistency across the codebase, please follow these
guidelines:

### R Style Guide

-   Follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)
-   Use meaningful variable and function names
-   Keep functions focused on a single task
-   Use `<-` for assignment, not `=`
-   Indent with 2 spaces (no tabs)

### Function Documentation

All exported functions must include roxygen2 documentation with: 
- `@title` and `@description`     
- `@param` for each parameter 
- `@return` describing the return value      
- `@examples` showing usage 
- `@export` if the function should be user-facing     

Example:

``` r
#' @title Estimate Network Causal Effects
#' @description Estimates treatment effects under network interference
#' @param X Matrix of covariates
#' @param Y Outcome vector
#' @param W Treatment assignment vector
#' @return A list containing estimated effects and standard errors
#' @examples
#' result <- estimate_effects(X, Y, W)
#' @export
estimate_effects <- function(X, Y, W) {
  # Function implementation
}
```

### Testing

-   All new features should include tests using `testthat`
-   Tests should be placed in the `tests/testthat/` directory
-   Aim for good coverage of edge cases and error conditions
-   Use `expect_equal()`, `expect_error()`, etc. for assertions

Example test structure:

``` r
test_that("estimate_effects works correctly", {
  # Setup test data
  X <- matrix(rnorm(100), ncol = 2)
  Y <- rnorm(50)
  W <- rbinom(50, 1, 0.5)
  
  # Run function
  result <- estimate_effects(X, Y, W)
  
  # Check results
  expect_type(result, "list")
  expect_true("effects" %in% names(result))
})
```

## Development Priorities

We are particularly interested in contributions related to:

1.  **Continuous Exposures**: Extending the package to handle multiple
    dosage levels (e.g., vaccine dosage)
2.  **Ensemble Methods**: Integration with random forest estimators for
    ensemble-based causal discovery (similar to grf building on
    causalTree)
3.  **Diagnostic Tools**: Developing sensitivity analysis tools under
    partial interference
4.  **CNI Assumption Testing**: Tools to assess whether the Conditional
    Network Independence assumption is reasonable for a given dataset
5.  **Performance Optimization**: Improving computational efficiency for
    large networks
6.  **Visualization Tools**: Enhanced plotting and visualization
    capabilities

## Questions and Support

If you have questions or need support:

1.  Check the package vignettes and documentation first
2.  Search existing [GitHub
    Issues](https://github.com/charliewang123/NetworkCausalTree/issues)
3.  If your question hasn't been addressed, open a new issue with the
    "question" label
